The quick brown mouse jumped over the tall frog.
Quick was the man who had to build the house.
Gone are the days of hardship and paradise.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Jack of All Trades Master of None.
Everything But The Kitchen Sink.
Barking Up The Wrong Tree.
A Fool and His Money are Soon Parted.
What Am I, Chopped Liver?
You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover.
Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining.
You Can't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks.
Birds of a Feather Flock Together.
